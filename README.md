# To-do List
## ðŸ“ŒOverview
A simple To-do list that can save your important activities for the day and drop it once you are done. The app is still in development and running by terminal CLI.

## ðŸ”¨Installation
* Click on "Releases" on the home page and download `log.txt` and the `To-doList.exe` file. 
* Run the `To-doList.exe` and test out the app
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure `log.txt` and `To-doList.exe` are on the same directory.

## :x:Known issues
* When choosing numbers, if you input characters other than numbers, the code will loop and crash.
> [!TIP]
> Just listen to what the program said and you should be safe!!!
* Only works on Windows <br>
Mainly because of this 2 lines of code:
```
system("cls");
```
```
system("pause");
```
* Using CLI can be quite the hassle
